# CNSLAM
CNSLAM stands for Configurable framework Not only for SLAM,  
But now it is just a kid, maybe called "Characteristically Naive Slam"  
\[WARNING\] There are lots of comments in the code without cleaning now, some for debugging, some for other function. Good for learning, Sorry for your reading. 
## dependency
- ceres for optimization
- pcl for point cloud visualization
- opencv
- eigen

## Module
For now, each module is an independent project. 

## to do
- Now Opencv functions are intensively used. I will reimplement some of these for better analysis and improvement for the 3DV algorithms and systems. 
## dataset used
